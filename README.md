## Alakazam's Hand
Alakazam's Hand is a game controller in the form of a glove. Created for our patient, Anna, who has muscular dystrophy to aid her in playing the video games she loves. Alakazam's Hand is able to detect hand movement and gestures using a gesture sensor, that movement is then converted into character controls based on which direction the hand has moved.

## Task Delegation
* Jason will manage the coding of the gesture sensor ensuring it accurately detects the correct movement.
* Sunny will code out the OLED display so that it will display an arrow corresponding to the gesture sensor data. He will update the README so that you can read me.
* ChatGPT will test the product and fix any bugs. ChatGPT will also make changes to the code so it is more efficient and organised.

## Current Status 
Gesture sensor configured and responsive
